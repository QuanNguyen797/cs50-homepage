# CS50 Homepage Project

This is my solution to the CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Homepage assignment (PSet 8).

## Description

A personal homepage built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It includes:

- A responsive navbar
- An intro section
- Links to "About", "Projects", and "Contact" pages
- A contact form with working inputs and a submit alert

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 
- JavaScript (jQuery)

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser. Everything is client-side and works offline.

## Notes

This project was completed as part of the CS50 Web course. I focused on clean structure, responsive design, and minimal but functional interactivity.
