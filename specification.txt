HTML tags:
1. <nav> – for the navbar at the top.
2. <section> – to separate the page into chunks like intro, about, form, etc.
3. <div> – to help lay things out or group content.
4. <h1> to <h4> – headings for different sections.
5. <p> – for normal paragraph text.
6. <form> – used in the contact section.
7. <input> – for name, email, and gender fields.
8. <select> and <option> – dropdown menu for visitor type.
9. <textarea> – for users to type a message.
10. <button> – submit button.
11. <footer> – copyright at the bottom.
12. <script> – for the JavaScript stuff.

CSS selectors I used:
- tag selectors like body, h1, form
- class selectors like .upper, .form, .submitbtn
- id selectors like #submit and #mainNavbar
- nested selectors like .lower > div > h2
- Bootstrap classes also helped with spacing and layout

CSS properties I used:
- background-color – for coloring sections
- color – for text colors
- padding – spacing inside elements
- display – mostly flex
- justify-content – for alignment
(also used min-height, transition, font-family, etc.)

Bootstrap:
I used Bootstrap mainly for the navbar, the form layout, and just making everything look less ugly by default. Also helped with responsiveness on mobile.

JavaScript:
I added some simple JavaScript to show a pop-up alert when someone clicks submit, and to change the navbar color when you scroll or open the mobile menu.

The site works on desktop and phone thanks to the flexbox model.
